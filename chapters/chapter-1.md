## 1. Progressive Web Application in a nutshell

### What is a Progressive Web App?

A Progressive Web App is:

- **Progressive** - Works for every user, regardless of browser choice because it's built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.

- **Responsive** - Fits any form factor: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.

- **Connectivity** independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low-quality networks.

- **App-like** - Feels like an app, because the app shell model separates the application functionality from application content.

- **Fresh** - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.

- **Safe** - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and to ensure content hasn't been tampered with.

- **Discoverable** - Is identifiable as an "application" thanks to W3C manifest and service worker registration scope, allowing search engines to find it.

- **Re-engageable** - Makes re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.

-  **Installable** - Allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

- **Linkable** - Easily share the application via URL, does not require complex installation.
